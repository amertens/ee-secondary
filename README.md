# ee-secondary
repo for scripts, results, figures, and replication files for EE sub-study secondary analyses

### file structure



### basic git commands


Check if you have made changes that you haven't pushed or another member has made changes that you haven't pulled
`git status`

Pull any changes made by other team members from the git repo to your local computer
`git pull`

Stage any changes you have made to be tracked by git
`git add -A`
Note: `-A` means all, can replace with name of specific file, but I find it easier to add all at once

Commit changes, with a short message as to what you changes
`git commit -m "short message here"`

Push all committed changes to shared repo
git push
